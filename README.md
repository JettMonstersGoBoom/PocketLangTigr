a plugin for pocketlang to enable use of Tigr Graphics Library

combining 

https://github.com/ThakeeNathees/pocketlang

and 

https://github.com/erkkah/tigr

using Pocketlang's plugin feature. 
this was developed before I realized there was a raylib implementation. 

only tested on windows machines with GCC.
